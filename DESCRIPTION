Description: The COVID-19 pandemic can be characterised by the epidemiological
    phenomenon and transmission dynamics of this novel coronavirus causing not
    only significant global health consequences but also societal and economic
    impacts. However, a much less recognised yet equally significant phenomenon
    of COVID-19 infodemic characterised as the excessive amount of information 
    about the pandemic, which makes the identification of a solution difficult
    and can spread misinformation, disinformation and rumours during the health 
    emergency has been co-existing. The infodemic has hampered an effective 
    public health response and hasa created confusion and distrust among people.
    We aim to document and analyse this phenomenon in the context of the
    Philippines.
