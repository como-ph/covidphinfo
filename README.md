The COVID-19 pandemic can be characterised by the epidemiological
phenomenon and transmission dynamics of this novel coronavirus causing
not only significant global health consequences but also societal and
economic impacts. However, a much less recognised yet equally
significant phenomenon of COVID-19 infodemic characterised as the
excessive amount of information about the pandemic, which makes the
identification of a solution difficult and can spread misinformation,
disinformation and rumours during the health emergency has been
co-existing. The infodemic has hampered an effective public health
response and hasa created confusion and distrust among people. We aim to
document and analyse this phenomenon in the context of the Philippines.
